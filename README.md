# TypeSafeLocalization
Test Project for NuGetPackage IntelliSoft.LocalizeMe

You can install the NuGetPackage IntelliSoft.LocalizeMe and create type safe localization.
This is the project, where you can see, how it works.

The idea behind this:
Getting localized strings in a type safe way.
No change of culture is done in background!
Take a look and let me know, how you like it.

I would be happy, when you support this project:

Limitation(s)
The NuGet Package was only tested within Visual Studio environment (not Visual Code)
Even it was not tested on an other platform than Windows
